Grammar Checking Application

Description:
This Grammar Checking Application is a tool developed in Python that helps users check the grammar of their written text and provides suggestions for corrections. The application utilizes the language-check library, which leverages LanguageTool under the hood, to perform grammar checks and offer suggestions for improving the text.

Features:
- Grammar Checking: The application allows users to input their text and performs a comprehensive grammar check using the language-check library.
- Error Highlighting: Detected grammar errors are displayed with the corresponding positions in the text, making it easier for users to identify and understand the issues.
- Error Suggestions: The application provides suggested corrections for grammar errors, enabling users to enhance their writing.
- Text Rewriting: Users have the option to automatically rewrite the corrected text based on the suggested corrections, facilitating the editing process.
- User-Friendly GUI: The application includes a graphical user interface developed with Tkinter, making it intuitive and easy to navigate.
